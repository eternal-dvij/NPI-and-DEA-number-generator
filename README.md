# NPI-and-DEA-number-generator
This repo is for NPI number generator and DEA number generator, the data most oftenly used in healthcare domain projects.




## DEA Number
A DEA number (DEA Registration Number) is a number assigned to a health care provider (such as a medical practitioner, dentist, or veterinarian) by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration allowing them to write prescriptions for controlled substances.


## NPI number
The NPI check digit is calculated using the ISO standard Luhn algorithm, which is a modulus 10 algorithm. The Luhn algorithm was designed to provide a simple method of preventing accidental typing errors. It is commonly used not only for validating NPI numbers, but also for validating credit card and IMEI numbers.

Before we proceed, let's briefly discuss the card issuer identifier. This identifier is used for the entity that issues a healthcare identification card. If the NPI is included as part of the card issuer identifier on a standard healthcare identification card, it will be preceded by the 5-digit identifier "80840". The initial two digits, "80", indicate health applications, while the last three digits, "840", represent the United States.

The NPI number serves as a distinct identifier for each healthcare provider or entity, and it is mandatory for all healthcare plans to utilize it in every administrative and financial transaction. Previously, health plans assigned their own ID numbers to providers, resulting in providers needing to utilize different IDs depending on the health plan they were submitting claims to. However, the implementation of the universal NPI number has greatly enhanced the efficiency of billing and tracking processes.

The NPI number is employed in various electronic transactions specified under HIPPA. Healthcare providers can also use it to identify both themselves and other providers in healthcare transactions and related communications. Additionally, physicians utilize it on prescriptions, health plans rely on it for their own communications and transactions, and it aids in the coordination of benefits across different health plans. Furthermore, the NPI number is used to identify healthcare providers in electronic patient medical records, and the Department of Health and Human Services utilizes it to track providers involved in fraud and abuse cases, among other functions.
